"Note"
"[1] Excludes census data for one or more incompletely enumerated Indian reserves or Indian settlements."
"[2] The 1996 category 'Chinese, n.o.s.' contains all responses of 'Chinese', including 'Mandarin', 'Cantonese' and 'Hakka'. Therefore it is not equivalent to the 2001 category 'Chinese, n.o.s.' but rather, equal to the sum of the 2001 categories of 'Chinese, n.o.s.', 'Mandarin', 'Cantonese' and 'Hakka'."
"[3] This is a subtotal of all non-official languages collected by the census that are not displayed separately here."
